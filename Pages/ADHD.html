                <p class="para3">Most people might be familiar with the topic of ADHD or ADD. ADD stands for Attention Deficit Disorder(happens while people can’t focus) and ADHD stands for Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder(happens while people can’t focus). ADHD and ADD are synonymous, as in they’re the same. ADD is an outdated usage for ADHD from 1960 to 1987 after which it involved ADHD to encompass more symptoms that people face during ADHD, which is an addiction to being inattentive and which includes both hyperactivity and impulsiveness.</p>

        <ul class="Red">
            <li>Hyperactivity, impulsivity, difficulties with focus, and trouble following conversations. These traits are listed in the diagnostic criteria.</li>
            <li>Emotional dysregulation (including rejection sensitivity), executive dysfunction, time management issues, struggles with delayed gratification, sleep problems, working memory difficulties, and sensory issues are not diagnostic criteria, but many people with ADHD experience these too.</li>
        </ul>
    <br>
        <h2 class="Blue">What can you do to manage ADHD?</h2>
    <br>
        <h3 class="Green">See your doctor</h3>
        <p>Autistic people tell us that going to the doctor can be stressful because they feel that health professionals do not understand their needs. However, seeing your doctor is an important step towards looking after yourself. Using tools like health passports may help your doctor understand your needs.</p>
        <br>
    
        <h3 class="Yellow">Medication</h3>
        <p>Different types of medication are available for ADHD, which may help someone feel more focused in their day-to-day life. For example, medication may help to increase concentration and reduce distractibility. Some autistic people may be more (or less) sensitive to medication. If you feel comfortable, speak to your doctor to discuss your options.</p>
        <br>
    
        <h3 class="Purple">Talking therapy and/or coaching</h3>
        <p>There are lots of different therapies that can help people better manage their ADHD, such as talking therapies. ADHD coaches can help you find tools and strategies to stay organised and on top of tasks.</p>
        <br>
    
        <h3 class="Pink">Exercise</h3>
        <p>Some research suggests that regular physical exercise can help young people with ADHD improve problem-solving, planning, processing and working memory.</p>
        <br>
    
        <h3 class="Indigo">Mindfulness and meditation</h3>
        <p>Although the findings from studies are mixed, some studies suggest that mindfulness and meditation can help alleviate inattention and hyperactivity/impulsivity for people with ADHD. Mindfulness isn’t always suitable for everyone. It might not be for you if it leaves you feeling more stressed and anxious than before you started.</p>

                    <p>
                        It's hard to focus and concentrate, and so at school Mack's grades started falling because she would find herself paying attention to a ton of things that weren't important, or at least that didn't have much to do with what they were studying. For instance, in Math, instead of paying attention to the teacher and the work on the board, she would be transfixed by a tiny crumb sitting on the edge of her desk.

                    <h3>ADHD in Women</h3>
                    <p>The video "Understanding Autism - Meet Ned" introduces Ned, a five-year-old boy with autism spectrum disorder, who
                        attends a special classroom and lives with his family. Despite some similarities to other children, Ned's autism
                        affects his communication, play, and interaction with others. The video highlights the importance of early intervention,
                        showcasing how Ned's family has learned to support him through therapy and has seen improvements in his daily life.
